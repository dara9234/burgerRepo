# burgerRepo


### Overview

I have built a burger logger with MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and ORM. It uses Node and MySQL to query,Express package to handle routing in "Eat Da Burger" app, and Handlebars to generate HTML.

The final app is deployed to Heroku for other users to view and use in real time!


### Folder Structure

* For this app, I have followed an specified folder structre and Created the main called `BurgerRepo`. Inside the folder, I have organized the directories and files for easy access and understaning!


### How the app works!

* The app lets users input the names of the burgers they would like to eat.

* Once a user submits a burger's name, the app will show the name of the burger on the left side of the page  waiting for the user to eat the burger.

* If the user devour the burger, the devoured burger is moved to the right side of the page showing that the burger is devoured!

* The app will store every burger in a database, whether devoured or not.

### Deployment and hosting on Heroku

The app is deployed on Heroku hosting server so other users should be able to enter the burger names and devour them!!!
